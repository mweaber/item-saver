# item-saver

Hello! Welcome to my personal Item Saver Map.

# What Is This App?

In this app I plan to allow the user to log in using Passport.js and BCrypt so they will be able to create a log of items for their personal character. 

Once logged in users will be able to add items/weapons/spells they are currently using so they can keep track. 

Once logged the user can update details and titles or simply delete an item. 

# What This App Uses

This will be using Node.js and Express as well as MongoDB, Mongoose, and Mongo Atlas. 

It will be hosted on Heroku and uses AWS servers. 

# Version Info 

1.0.0 - Creating app and initial testing.
